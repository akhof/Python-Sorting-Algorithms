# Python-Sorting-Algorithms
In this project I implemented a few sorting algorithms in Python.
I also created a little comparison script to compare all these algorithm - you can find it's output bellow.

## Algorithms
I implemented this algorithms: BadAlgorithm, BuubleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort and HeapSort

## Comparison script output
```
